This is a story of friends, loves,  mistakes, lessons, and experiences. It probably is not true, but it is certainly filled with truth.

I will be writing it over the next few months, in public, using VIM to process and GitHub to track changes. Feel free to follow along, as well to follow me on the interwebs. Most places (like Twitter) I am @AlcesBull.
